Save a daily status report (DSR) note into the local PM memory database.

Use this tool to persist short project updates such as:
- what was done
- what changed
- blockers or risks
- next steps

Guidelines:
- Keep notes concrete and concise.
- Include tags when helpful (for example: feature, bug, blocker, release).
- Use one call per DSR entry.
