# Local Repo Rules (dax-cli-standalone)

- This repository is the only write target for implementation work.
- `opencode` under `~/MYAIAGENTS/opencode` is read-only reference material.
- Never apply patches, commits, or generated files in `opencode`.
- Use `opencode` only for comparison and migration context.
- All code, docs, tests, and commits must be made in `dax-cli-standalone`.
